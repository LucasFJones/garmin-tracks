Here are some plots to edit Garmin (or other chart plotters) data, isolate important tracks, and export back to device. There are also scripts to use .gpx files to calculate speed and plot values.

If you want to make plots of where you've been in R, or calculate speed data then check out this [script](https://github.com/LucasFJones/garmin-tracks/blob/main/scripts/data_analysis_and_plot.R). See below what it can create.
